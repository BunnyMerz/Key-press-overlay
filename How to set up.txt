main_config.txt inside the main folder has all the basic configurations such as:

margin_right: Integer in pixels.
	Stands for the distance between each side of each key
margin_bottom: Integer in pixels
	Stands for the distance between each side of each key
package_name: String of all charachters, except  / 
	Name of the folder inside the folder called packages that is going to be used for the images


Inside the package there must be a config.txt.
For that, these are the instructions:

# Any line started by # is ignored. Remember to not let any empty lines.
#
# # All images must have the same width X height,
# # except for the key.png that must have double the width of the rest and same height
# # Default Package has 40x40 as default size.
# # key.png width and height determines the size of all other icons
#
# # "key.png" cannot be abscent and will be the frame for the icons, being a 80x40 instead of a 40x40 like all other images
# # each half of the 80x40 represents a different state: The first half represents unpressed, the second
# # represents pressed. At least for now, the background of the program is, by default, rgb[55, 239, 0] (found in main_config.txt).
# # Having the key.png have that color will later on, once the chroma key is setted up, become transparent background.
#
# # Patterns are how the keys are gonna be placed around
# # Patterns have numbers, separated by single spaces
#
# # Key labels and Number patterns are separated bye an empty line
#
# # Numbers are labled before deciding the pattern (You can also have symbols or letters, if you want to keep the pattern clean)
# # 0's stand for blank, Numbers stand for whatever you named them to be
# # The keys you labled,at the end of that line, will react based on what keys they are attached to (check key.txt to see all keys names).
# # More then one key having the same number will make only the last key labled with that number work.
#
#
# # Example on how to use:
#
# # # number/file_name/key
# # # 1/my_pretty_pic.png/s
# # # 2/wowee.png/w
# # # 3/wowee.png/d
# # # 4/wowee.png/a
# # #                     (Notice this empty line between both lables and pattern)
# # # 0 2 0 0 0
# # # 4 1 3 0 0

any file name that doesn't exist will make the app crash
any unmapped key will also crash the app
